## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}
 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a sophomore at Cornell University studying Biological Engineering. I’m passionate about using engineering to improve human health and quality of life, especially in areas like prosthetics, biomaterials, and medical technology. I enjoy combining hands-on design with analytical problem-solving, and I’m always excited to learn new tools and take on technical challenges. I’m currently exploring opportunities in bioengineering where I can contribute to meaningful, real-world impact.
