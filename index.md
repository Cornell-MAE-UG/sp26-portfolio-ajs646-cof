## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }})

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore at Cornell studying Biological Engineering. I’m interested in prosthetics, biomaterials, and how engineering can be applied to making a difference in the world. I’ve worked with Java, Python, and SolidWorks, and I enjoy building anything mechanical. I’m currently looking for opportunities in bioengineering.
